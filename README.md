How do you use spreadsheets in your research? If you're like many researchers, your spreadsheets include not only data, but plots, color coding, calculations and stray research notes.

* The upside: everything is in one human-readable place. 
* The downside: this format makes it difficult to move from analyzing and visualizing your data by hand to automated workflows. 

This workshop will show you how to prepare your data for analysis in statistical programs and programming languages like R and Python.
